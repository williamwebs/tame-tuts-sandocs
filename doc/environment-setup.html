  <h1>Environment Setup</h1>

  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    Use whatever coding language or framework you prefer - whether developing
    with tools on Windows or with Linux tools on the Windows Subsystem for
    Linux, this guide will help you get set up and install what you need to
    start coding, debugging, and accessing services to put your work into
    production.
  </p>

  <h2>Setup on Windows</h2>
  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    This allows you to run your Native app on a physical device without setting
    up a development environment. If you want to run your app on the Simulator
    or an Virtual Device, please refer to the instructions for "Native CLI
    Quickstart" to learn how to install or set up your development environment.
  </p>

  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    Once you've set these up, you can launch your app on an Virtual Device by
    running <span class="font-w-700">`npm run name`</span>, or on the Simulator
    by running
    <span class="font-w-700">`npm run`</span>
  </p>

  <h3>Caveats</h3>
  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    Because you don't build any native code when create a project, it's not
    possible to include custom native modules beyond the Native APIs and
    components that are available in the client app.
  </p>

  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    If you know that you'll eventually need to include your own native code,
    Expo is still a good way to get started. In that case you'll need to "eject"
    eventually to create your own native builds. If you do eject, the "Native
    CLI Quickstart" instructions will be required to continue working on your
    project.
