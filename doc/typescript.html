  <h1>Typescript</h1>
  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a
    nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually
    says nothing,” Before & After magazine
    <span class="doc-link">answered a curious reader</span>, “Its ‘words’
    loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which
    is why at a glance it looks pretty real.”
  </p>

  <h2>The placeholder</h2>
  <p class="font-w-500">
    The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
    consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin because in its youth,
    centuries ago, it was Latin.

  <div class="code-block m-1-auto rounded">
    <code class="code font-w-600"
      >class <span class="text-primary">ShoppingList</span> extends

      <span class="text-primary">render</span>() { return ( <<span

  <h3>Richard McClintock</h3>
  <p class="font-w-500">
    Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is
    <span class="doc-link">credited</span> with discovering the source behind
    the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest
    was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word.
  </p>

  <h3>Consulting</h3>
  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et
    Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from
    the Roman philosopher Cicero.
  </p>
  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear an unmistakable
    resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of Cicero's work, with the most notable
    passage excerpted below:
  </p>

  <!-- blockquote -->

  <blockquote class="blockquote font-w-700">
    <q>
      <i
        >Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet,
        consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora
        incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem</i
      ></q
    >
  </blockquote>

  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    A 1914 English translation by Harris Rackham reads:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="blockquote font-w-700">
    <q>
      <i
        >Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of
        itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in
        which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</i
      ></q
    >
  </blockquote>

  <p class="font-w-500 m-1-auto">
    McClintock's eye for detail certainly helped narrow the whereabouts of lorem
    ipsum's origin, however, the “how and when” still remain something of a
    mystery, with competing theories and timelines.
