1.  on the documentation page, how do i render dynamically the sub-menu contents
    on the sidebar to the main page (and the internal links, on the rightbar)?

        e.g: 
            - Getting Started
                -- Introduction (sidebar sub-menu)
                -- Prerequisite (sidebar sub-menu)
.......

how do I render the prerequisite content on the 'main content' section of the page.

2.  Is there any logic to keep track of the current page and display the next & previous
    pages links on the footer of each content in the 'main content' section of the page?

e.g:
    on the Introduction page, Prerequisite (sub-menu) is next...
    how do I get the 'prerequisite' to be displayed as the next page 
    at the bottom of the Introduction page

PS: do I create separate pages for each of the submenus??
    or is there an alternative

The main website on <https://sandocs.vercel.app/> was built in React.js using Next.js as a framwork and with that it's easierfor the state to change on clik.

We can only mimick that, or by create advance <onState change> javascript code to serve a a framworkthat can change state of <DOM> and fetch content on load
For now since it's an html template, then you can simple create each files separately.

Prerequisite.html 
Installation.html and so on...

to make code cleaner, i'll create a new folder called doc and include all document related html inside of it.

Take note that since, its a folder, we must have the <index> file. else user's will have to see the folder content itsel, which we do not want to happen.

I created a sample just to show you it's possible for someone to create it's own custom wrapper for website to work on state loading 
without actually loading the full content. But this is more possible using a framework and not with core <html> alone.
